# Covid19 Global Forecasting

The **Covid19 Global Forecasting** project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Regressor and K-Neighbors Regressor, to predict Covid-19 case fatalities and confirmed cases. The project also includes visualizations using Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib to analyze and present Covid-19 data globally.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Visualize Covid-19 cases among countries.
  - Analyze the count of Covid-19 cases with respect to the population.
  - Display confirmed cases and fatalities.
  - Identify the top 10 most populous countries and their Covid-19 cases.
  - Illustrate worldwide Covid-19 growth over time.
  - Examine the growth of Covid-19 cases by country over time.
  - Present the growth of Covid-19 numbers in the top 10 most populous countries.

- **Predictive Modeling**: 
  - Use Random Forest Regressor and K-Neighbors Regressor to predict fatalities and confirmed cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **RandomForestRegressor**: For predicting the number of fatalities and confirmed cases.
- **KNeighborsRegressor**: For predictive modeling of Covid-19 cases.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting data and creating static graphs.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shreya2430/Covid19GlobalForecasting.git
    cd Covid19GlobalForecasting
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    Execute the script to start the analysis and visualizations:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
- After running the application, the visualizations will be generated based on the available Covid-19 data.
- Review the generated plots to analyze the trends and predictions for Covid-19 cases and fatalities.
